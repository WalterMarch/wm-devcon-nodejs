# wm-devcon-nodejs - Visual Studio Code devcontainer for Node.js

## Sample Dev Container file(s) for Node.js in VS Code Containerized Development

*assumptions*: Docker and VS Code installed as well as the Dev Containers extension for Visual Studio Code.

*usage*: clone the repo then open in Visual Studio Code.

*example*:  clone the repo; open a new VS Code window; open the directory containing this repo; when prompted, choose Reopen in Container. 

To start off, I'm using the defaults for node.js generated by Visual Studio Code with only a couple additions to `devcontainer.json`
(some `extensions` as well as the `mounts` and `postCreateCommand` sections.).
